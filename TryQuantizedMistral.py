# Recall
prompt = 'Who was the president in 2003 and why?'
print(llm(prompt))
answer = '''
I am unable to definitively answer that question without more context. The year 2003 saw the presidency of three different world leaders: George W. Bush in the United States, Vicente Fox Quesada in Mexico, and Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in NATO (as they are not countries but organizations, their heads are not formally considered presidents but their titles involve some overlap). If you could specify which country's president in 2003 you were asking about, I would be happy to help answer that question.
George W. Bush was the President of the United States from January 20, 2001, to January 20, 2009. He was reelected for a second term in 2004 and led the US during significant events such as the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War.
Vicente Fox Quesada served as President of Mexico from December 1, 2000, to November 30, 2006. He was the first president from the National Action Party (PAN) in Mexican history and focused on economic reforms, energy policy, and foreign relations during

answer = '''
I'd be happy to help answer your question, but I need to clarify that I'm an artificial intelligence language model, not able to hold historical knowledge on its own. However, I can tell you that in the United States, George W. Bush was the president in 2003. He assumed office on January 20, 2001, and was subsequently reelected on November 2, 2004. His first term extended into 2003, making him the president during that year as well.
As for why he became president, Bush won the presidential election on November 7, 2000, in a controversial and contentious election with Vice President Al Gore that came down to just a few states â€“ Florida in particular. The outcome was not determined until the Supreme Court stepped in and issued a decision on December 12, 2000, which ultimately led to Bush's victory.
In summary, George W. Bush was the president of the United States from January 20, 2001, to January 20, 2009. He became president following a contentious election in 2000 and served one term before being reelected in 2004.

# Communicate Complex Topics
prompt = 'Explain the difference between quantum physics and Newtonian physics.'
print(llm(prompt))
answer = '''
Quantum Physics and Newtonian Physics are two fundamental pillars of classical science which govern how the physical world behaves at different scales and levels of complexity. Although they both attempt to describe the natural world, they employ vastly different conceptual frameworks and mathematical tools to explain physical phenomena.
Newtonian Physics: Newtonian physics is a classical mechanics theory that describes the motion and behavior of objects based on three fundamental laws of motion proposed by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 17th century. These laws state that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net force, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and in the direction of that force, and every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This framework works exceptionally well for describing large-scale phenomena such as the motion of planets, cars, or baseballs.
Quantum Physics: Quantum physics is a fundamental theoretical framework that describes nature at the atomic and subatomic level, which often deviates from classical Newtonian physics. It was developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to explain phenomena such as the photo

# Combine Recall and Reasoning
prompt = 'Briefly explain the role of carbon in biological life, and suggest another element that could serve a similar role.'
print(llm(prompt))
answer = '''
Carbon is an essential element for all known forms of life on Earth. It is the backbone of organic molecules, including carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Carbon's unique property of forming stable covalent bonds with other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur allows it to create complex structures that are necessary for life.
Another element that could potentially serve a similar role to carbon in biological systems is silicon. Silicon is the second most abundant element on Earth's crust and is a crucial component of various materials such as glass, sand, and quartz. In biology, silicon is found in some organisms, particularly diatoms and certain types of algae, where it is used to form the structure of their cell walls. These organisms use silicon to create intricate shells made of silica, which provide protection and help them float in water. However, unlike carbon, silicon does not form a wide variety of complex organic molecules, so its role in biological systems is limited compared to carbon.

# Sarcasm
prompt = 'Analyze the sentiment of the following statement: "I just love waiting in traffic, it us the highlight of my day."'
print(llm(prompt))
answer = '''
The sentiment expressed in the statement is positive. The speaker has used the phrase "love" to express their enjoyment or pleasure towards waiting in traffic. However, it's important to note that this statement may not reflect a typical or common sentiment towards waiting in traffic. Some people find sitting in traffic frustrating and stressful, so the fact that someone enjoys it might be surprising or even amusing to others. Overall, the statement is positive in tone, but it's also worth considering the context in which it was made to better understand its true meaning.
'''
print(llm(pre + prompt + post, max_new_tokens=450, repetition_penalty=1.1, temperature=1.2))
answer = '''
Based on the given statement, the sentiment expressed is highly negative. The speaker is expressing enjoyment for an experience that is generally considered to be unpleasant and time-consuming, which goes against the common sentiment towards waiting in traffic. Additionally, using "it is" instead of "I love it when..." indicates sarcasm or insincerity. In summary, this statement appears to be expressing a strong dislike for waiting in traffic rather than enjoying it.

Title: The Solar Sleuth
In the heart of Neo-Tokyo, nestled among skyscrapers that stretched towards the heavens and dazzling holographic billboards, Detective Hiroshi Matsuda sat in his solar-powered cruiser, a sleek vehicle designed to blend seamlessly with the city's sustainable infrastructure. His keen eyes scanned the metropolis below for any hint of abnormality.
A sudden flash of red on one of the holographic news tickers caught Hiroshi's attention. A renowned scientist, Dr. Akira Ito, had been found dead in his laboratory late last night. The cause was unknown, but rumors swirled about a potential breakthrough stolen technology or foul play.
Hiroshi activated the eco-friendly engine of his cruiser and headed towards the scene. As he approached, he marveled at how the city had transformed itself into an eco-utopia. Solar panels adorned every rooftop, wind turbines spun gracefully above streets lined with lush greenery, and electric vehicles zipped along magnetically levitated tracks.

In the heart of Neo-Arcadia, a dazzling metropolis known for its avant-garde innovation and relentless commitment to sustainability, Detective Alina Varga pored over the latest case to hit their lab: The vanishing acts of four groundbreaking scientists. Their disappearance had left the city's Council in disarray and gripped its citizenry in terror. Aiming to preserve Neo-Arcadia's tranquility, Alina knew she could rely on no carbon-emitting technology in her pursuit for the truth.
Donning a radiant tunic of Econyl fiber - renewable nylon made from recycled marine debris â€“ Detective Varga hopped onto an AgriVelo; an ecofriendly tricycle harnessed with solar panels, and powered off into the futuristic landscape of urban vertical farming, transparent architectures that optimally used daylight, and hydroponic water gardens. The wind stirred beneath the fabric city roof as a soothing breeze from nearby air purifiers wafted through her curls, promising clarity as they neared her first suspect, Doctor Morikami; botanist renowned for creating a carbon neutral crop revolution that thrived within urban hydroponic gardens.
Arriving at his lab, a breathtaking blend of technology and biology named EcoSphere, Alina engaged Doctor Morikami through non-invasive facial recognition software - "Dr. Morikami, your recent whereabouts, please." While he complied, she absorbed her surroundings, each plant exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen as their solar panels harvested energy in tandem, symbiotically balancing ecology with sustainability.
As the doctor's location data confirmed an uncharacteristic late night absence - or what Neo-Arcadia deemed 'twilight disconnect hours', to ensure city balance while optimally reaping bioluminescent hues - Detective Varga found it odd. However, she couldn't ignore the pang of unease that surged through her core, wondering
